An R markdown document with some text and code for Data Science class

Named chunk

```{r head}
head(mtcars, n=5)
```

\pagebreak
Starting from the new page

As markdown uses its own environment, you need to read file into its environment to work with it

The following chunck will read the csv file but the code will not be dislpayed


```{r, echo=FALSE}
winter <- read.csv("winter.csv")
```

Now you can work with winter dataframe
The following chunk will show the head of the dataframe without showing the R code. The chunk is named winter

```{r winter, echo=FALSE}
head(winter, n=6)
```

\newpage
Starting from the new page

The following chunk will show the r code but will not evaluate it

```{r, eval=F}
head(winter, n=6)
```

You have named the chunk previously as winter, here you can refer to that chunk

Formating the Text

use # for headers

# Big

## Medium

### Small

Make Bullet points with emphasize

* **bold text here**
* *italic*
* _italic text here_
