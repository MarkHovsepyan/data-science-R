#Task

In our lectures, we talked about how to get data from nba.com. 
------------------
Your goal is to download certain data from there (whatever you want) and make a shiny dashboard to vizualize and summarize the results. 

You need to do some extra research on the meaning of the variables and statistics. Nba.com is a good source.
------------------
Note!!!
NBA API is not officially documented, so you need to do try/error until will get what you want. So I suggest you to start as soon as possible.

This is an individual project.
The probability that two students will end up with the same shiny app is zero.

If you have some other sport-related idea, let me know we can discuss.
-----------------
You need to
  - Submit R shiny code.
  - Upload your app to shinyapps.io.
  - Send the link
